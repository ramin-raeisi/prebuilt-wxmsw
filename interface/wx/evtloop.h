/**
    @class wxEventLoopBase

    Base class for all event loop implementations.

    An event loop is a class which queries the queue of native events sent
    to the wxWidgets application and dispatches them to the appropriate
    wxEvtHandlers.

    An object of this class is created by wxAppTraits::CreateEventLoop() and
    used by wxApp to run the main application event loop.
    Temporary event loops are usually created by wxDialog::ShowModal().

    You can create your own event loop if you need, provided that you restore
    the main event loop once yours is destroyed (see wxEventLoopActivator).

    /**
        Yields control to pending messages in the windowing system.

        This can be useful, for example, when a time-consuming process writes to a
        text window. Without an occasional yield, the text window will not be updated
        properly, and on systems with cooperative multitasking, such as Windows 3.1
        other processes will not respond.

        Caution should be exercised, however, since yielding may allow the
        user to perform actions which are not compatible with the current task.
        Disabling menu items or whole menus during processing can avoid unwanted
        reentrance of code: see ::wxSafeYield for a better function.
        You can avoid unwanted reentrancies also using IsYielding().

        Note that Yield() will not flush the message logs. This is intentional as
        calling Yield() is usually done to quickly update the screen and popping up
        a message box dialog may be undesirable. If you do wish to flush the log
        messages immediately (otherwise it will be done during the next idle loop
        iteration), call wxLog::FlushActive.

        Calling Yield() recursively is normally an error and an assert failure is
        raised in debug build if such situation is detected. However if the
        @a onlyIfNeeded parameter is @true, the method will just silently
        return @false instead.

    /**
        Works like Yield() with @e onlyIfNeeded == @true, except that it allows
        the caller to specify a mask of the ::wxEventCategory values which
        indicates which events should be processed and which should instead
        be "delayed" (i.e. processed by the main loop later).

        Note that this is a safer alternative to Yield() since it ensures that
        only the events you're interested to will be processed; i.e. this method
        helps to avoid unwanted reentrancies.

        Note that currently only wxMSW and wxGTK do support selective yield of
        native events coming from the underlying GUI toolkit.
        wxWidgets events posted using wxEvtHandler::AddPendingEvent or
        wxEvtHandler::QueueEvent are instead selectively processed by all ports.
